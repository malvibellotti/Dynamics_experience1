1)  Write the input file with the common format in input_raw.txt
    the format should NOT be the same as the example in figure8.in
    the number of bodies and the time are automatically set, you can change the txt file manually if you want

2)  run the program called Praw_to_converted, once you do that you get 2 files
    the first one is called conversion_parameters and it's needed for the reverse conversion program
    the second one is called input_converted.txt and it's the file you should use with the C code, just like figure8.in
    you would write something like a.exe < input_converted.txt

3)  run the C code but use a.exe < input_converted.txt > output_converted.txt
    this way you write the results on the output text file which can then be read by the reverse conversion program

4)  run the program called Pconverted_to_raw, if everything is correct you should get a txt file with as many as rows as number of bodies times number of cycles created by the C code
    if you have 3 bodies the first 3 rows are from the first cycle, the second try from the second etcs
